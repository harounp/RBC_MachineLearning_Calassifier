# RBC_MachineLearning_Calassifier
This goal of this project is to create a reliable model which can identify differences in red blood cells
and classify them as abnormal or healthy. With the inital development of of this project we are only 
interested in burr cells and healthy cells leaving us with a binary classification. We plan to expand this 
classification to include sickle cells and white blood cell identification.

Due to the nature of project, only a portion of the code can be shared publicly.
