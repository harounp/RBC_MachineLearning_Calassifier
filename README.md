# RBC_MachineLearning_Calassifier
This goal of this project is to create a reliable model which can identify differences in red blood cells
and classify them as abnormal or healthy. With the inital development of of this project we are only 
interested in burr cells and healthy cells leaving us with a binary classification. We plan to expand this 
classification to include sickle cells and white blood cell identification.

Looking at the files in this respoitory you will find the tensorflow model, the code used to create the model, 
the rotations file used to expand the training set, the segmentation code used to identify every cell in 
an image seperately and later on the webapp UI in which the model was deployed on.
